This is an R Markdown document. It is my submission for the peer assignment #1 of Coursera's "Reproducible Research" course.

# Setup

We load any additional package that might be needed.

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(lattice)

Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C") # override the Brazilian locale
```

# Loading data

First, we load and process ("clean") the data.

```{r}
setwd('c:/cygwin64/home/00240181/src/ReproducibleResearch/RepData_PeerAssessment1')
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data.clean <- data[which(data$steps != "NA"), ]
```

It is valid to check the data to have an idea about how it is structured.

```{r}
summary(data.clean)
head(data.clean)
```

# First question

Code for the question **What is mean total number of steps taken per day?**

```{r}
# extract the "total number of steps taken each day" and show a summary
daily.steps <- ddply(data.clean, .(date), summarise, steps = sum(steps))
summary(daily.steps)

# plot the distribution and get a summary of the data
hist(daily.steps$steps, main="Physical activity", xlab="steps per day")

```

The mean number of steps is `r sprintf('%.2f', mean(daily.steps$steps))`, while the median is `r sprintf('%.0f', median(daily.steps$steps))`.

# Second question

Code for the question **What is the average daily activity pattern?**

```{r}
# extract the data
average.steps <- ddply(data.clean, .(interval), summarise, steps = mean(steps))

# plot the avarage daily activity
plot(average.steps$interval, average.steps$steps, type = "l", xlab = "5-minute interval", 
    ylab = "steps", main = "Average activity (number of steps per interval)")

# extract the 5-minute interval with the maximum number of steps
average.steps[average.steps$steps == max(average.steps$steps), ]
```

# Third question

Code for the question **Imputing missing values**.

The total number of missing values is `r sum(is.na(data$steps))`.

```{r}
# replaces NA's with the 5-minute interval average
data.corrected <- data
data.corrected[is.na(data$steps), "steps"] <- mean(na.omit(data.corrected$steps))

# extract the data
daily.steps.corrected <- ddply(data.corrected, .(date), summarise, steps = sum(steps))

# plot the distribution and get a summary of the data
hist(daily.steps.corrected$steps, main="Physical activity (NA's corrected)", xlab="steps per day")
```

The mean number of steps is `r sprintf('%.2f', mean(daily.steps.corrected$steps))`, while the median is `r sprintf('%.0f', median(daily.steps.corrected$steps))`. These values don't differ significately from the first part of the assignment, and we conclude that in this case the missing data does not affect the analysis.

# Fourth question

Code for the questions **Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?**

```{r}
weekdays <- weekdays(as.Date(data.corrected$date))
data.weekdays <- transform(data.corrected, day = weekdays)
data.weekdays$wk <- ifelse(data.weekdays$day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
data.week_quest <- ddply(data.weekdays, .(interval, wk), summarise, steps = mean(steps))

xyplot(steps ~ interval | wk, data = data.week_quest, layout = c(1, 2), type = "l")

summary(subset(data.week_quest, wk=='weekend'))
summary(subset(data.week_quest, wk=='weekday'))
```

We verify that the average and the maximum number of steps is higher on weekdays. Future work should test the hypothesis that this difference is not random.
